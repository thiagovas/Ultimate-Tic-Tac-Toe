\section{Introduction}

TODO: Talk a little bit about the classic tic-tac-toe, who invented, a little bit of history, that kind of stuff.\\

Then, talk a little bit about the ultimate version of the game, why it's interesting to study it, and stuff like that.
Remember: $3^{81}$.

\section{Game Rules}
TODO: Talk about the rules of the game



\section{Related Work}
Talk a little bit about the related works.\\
That paper that the authors showed equivalent classes of the board.\\
There is also the AI's available online.\\
And maybe more...



\section{Payoff Table}
Probably I'm going to define more than one payoff table.\\
Talk about the tables, why I chose the payoffs described in which one of them.



\section{AI}
\subsection{Alpha-Beta Prunning v1}
With the first function for the $A^*$.

\subsection{Alpha-Beta Prunning v2}
With the second function I defined for the $A^*$.




\section{Experiments}
Show the experiments comparing the results 



\section{Future Work}
(1) For now, there is just the monte carlo tree search.\\
(2) Maybe create more payoff tables.\\
(3) Consider using cython, or any optimizer, given that I used python, and used it for simplicity.\\
(4) Make some pruning using the equivalent classes from that nice paper.



\section{Conclusion}
